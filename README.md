Each category has its own dedicated page (`TheNoshCo_Nuts_page.html`, `TheNoshCo_Fruits_page.html`, `TheNoshCo_Coffee_page.html`) where you can view all available items.

### Upcoming Functionality
- **Shopping Basket**: A feature to review selected items before purchase is under development and will be available soon.

- **Social Media Integration**: In future updates, we plan to integrate functionality that will allow you to like products and share your selections directly on social media platforms. This will include options to comment on and recommend items within your social networks.

### Current Limitations
- The site currently does not communicate with the outside world, such as back-end servers or APIs, which means all features are simulated within the local environment. This will change as we introduce server-side functionality in upcoming releases.

### Tips for Optimal Experience
- **Browser Compatibility**: For the best experience, use a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- **Local Testing**: If you encounter issues while testing locally, ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser, as our site relies heavily on JavaScript for dynamic content and interactivity.
